Now let's put our best foot forward.\n  - Add a public profile and cover photo\n  - Add a brief bio\n  - Add a link to your website or social media accounts\n  - Find the `Public profile URL` to see what it looks like\n1. **Update your public workspace overview**: You've already updated the [visibility of your workspace to public](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#creating-a-public-workspace). Click on the workspace name next to the globe icon in the top left to open the overview tab. Here's some optional suggestions to personalize this workspace:\n  - Update the summary and description\n  - Change the name of the workspace \n\n  At the bottom, review a count of all the collections you've forked to this workspace, along with all the other entities and a running log of your updates.\n1. **Leave a comment**: Leave a [comment](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/commenting-on-collections/#commenting-on-a-collection) on the collection or folder and [tag](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/commenting-on-collections/#tagging-members-in-comments) yourself in the comment.\n1. **Search for your workspace**: Use the search bar in the top center to find your public workspace. This will be easier to find if you gave your workspace a unique name in the first challenge. Updates to this data will take a while to index in the search results.\n\nThat's all for this challenge. There is no local validation check this time, but this information will come in handy for the final check.",
